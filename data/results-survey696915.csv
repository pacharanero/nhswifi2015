Again, the ability to maintain daily living activities becomes important.  Neither of these require WiFi necessarily but WiFI makes life so much easier and more practical than wired connections - particularly on wards and when using BYOD devices.

WiFi is needed to support flexible use of buildings and modern ways of working.  Examples include reconfiguring rooms, the use of hot-desk areas, support for electronic working in meeting rooms.

It is unreliable and the hardware is so slow and old fashioned. My desktop is over 10 years old. I'm not allowed a laptop or mobile as my manager thinks that because I am often in the treatment room I don't need to be able to work anywhere else. The signal on the site for 3G is appalling and my personal phone will not load emails when I am there. It's ok because I work part time there I  also have another job with a different NHS organisation where signal is better and we all have mobiles to use in the hospital. This is much easier and enables you to be found and talk to people when you aren't in the clinic. The IT people are lovely but they aren't on site and sometimes you just need to have someone look at something in person. I work for a social enterprise but embedded in a nhs hospital and this leads to all sorts of issues with firewalls. My other job is with a foundation trust and I think things are streets ahead here. The systems are also peculiar. I wish systmone was everywhere rather than having to negotiate lots and lots of different systems to get the same info in different ways from different organisations. Numbers of passwords that you have to remember is daft too. My husband is a director of a mental health trust and it is annoying to see that they have ipads and iphones and wifi and encrypted password stores but clinical staff like me are working with a nokia that is 4th hand and 10 years old and I am not allowed wifi or even a laptop. Why is there no choice about what you can use that will suit you individually. Quite honestly I would like to buy and use my own machine and have an allowance to have the phone I want and wifi rather than have IT solutions imposed on me by people who have never asked me what I want and need to do my job and have no insight into the issues that I have.

As a result, we have scrapped the use of wifi devices and reverted back to using a PC in the treatment room, reserving the wifi device for conducting patient information chats only, which are embarassingly slow. The introduction of another computer device has resulted in a near miss incident and a rapid change to the method of IDing patients to ensure the same patient is open across the three electronic data sources used - this would only be 2 sources if a wifi device is used, thereby reducing the risk of an error.",SQ002,SQ003,,SQ003,SQ002,SQ002,SQ002,SQ002,SQ003,5,,RH1 5RH,,573.58,,,,,,,,,,,
